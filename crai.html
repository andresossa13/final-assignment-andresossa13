      The objective was to develop a fresh design for the landing page of the upcoming Crai Supermarkets' general line, as well as for the individual product or product group pages. The aim was to highlight the enhancements in the new private label design, improve the perception of brand quality, and enhance its overall attractiveness. This was intended to drive a higher preference for the retail brand and foster greater shopper loyalty towards the store.

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      The client had the expectation for us to focus on the concept of "La Dolce Vita," which serves as a synthesis of one of the most cherished and nostalgic periods in recent Italian history (the 50s and 60s). This era was characterized by a lifestyle filled with joy, carefree attitudes, and glamour. Incorporating this concept would align well with the current trend of nostalgia and would be in harmony with the brand's positioning.

      The new proposal has the objective of capturing the consumer's attention while effectively conveying the attributes and values of the product in alignment with various product categories. This endeavor seeks to strengthen Crai's image through a tailored storytelling approach.

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      We placed significant emphasis on the fact that Crai is currently introducing a fresh strategy founded on a set of values that customers can readily recognize and relate to. The main goal is to establish unique grounds for customer preference and distinguish themselves from competitors. Within this context, private labels offer Crai a valuable opportunity to foster preference and cultivate loyalty. They serve as a sort of "experimental phase" in the interaction between customers and the brand. Our intention is to further enhance this connection by adding supplementary value content.
