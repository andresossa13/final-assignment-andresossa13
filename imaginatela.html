    This project addresses this need by offering children the opportunity to personalize their clothes based on their preferences and characteristics. They can explore different materials and tools for designing, thereby giving their clothes a personal touch. Imaginatela offers three distinct methods for children to customize their clothes.

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
    The pandemic has become a decisive factor for parents when purchasing clothes for their children in physical stores, as they prefer to avoid exposing them. The selection of children’s clothes is often limited to what the market offers or the parent’s taste, making it a mechanical or boring process. However, children aged six and older have a strong desire to choose their own clothes, which poses a challenge for parents. One of the effects observed during the pandemic is an increase in domestic violence, which has negatively impacted the parent-child relationship and become an emotional issue.

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      Children want their clothes to reflect their personal tastes, but often struggle to find figures, characters, and animations of their choice. While today’s children find entertainment on various digital media platforms, they also seek experiences with more analog interaction. Therefore, the market needs to provide different avenues for customizing clothes, fostering creativity and aiding the development of cognitive abilities.

      1. Using only basic analog elements such as drawing and painting, allowing the children’s creativity to shine through in their creations.
      <br><br>
      2. Employing drawing techniques and printed templates to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing result in the creation process.
      <br><br>
      3. Utilizing a design platform where children can easily bring their ideas to life with the help of digital software, ensuring an optimal outcome.

      ImaginaTela is a combination of two characteristic elements in the product, “Imagine” and “Tela” (which means fabric in Spanish). With ImaginaTela, children’s imagination, artistic skills, and creativity are expressed in everything they like and feel connected to. A garment is a reflection of who we are, what we feel, and what brings us comfort.
