    We developed a product called Namna, aself-sustaining system specifically designed for farmers and croppers in Tumaco, Colombia. Through seven industrial processes, we created a medicinal balm that harnesses the healing and anesthetic properties of the coca leaf to treat patients suffering from skin diseases like Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, which are spread by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies.

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
    In Colombia, the methods used for crop eradication are detrimental and aggressive to both the environment and the producers involved. For many indigenous communities in Tumaco, illegal crops are their sole source of profitable economic income. Tumaco is a municipality located in the department of Nariño and holds the highest concentration of coca plantations in the country. The region of Tumaco, with its favorable geographical position and rivers flowing into the Pacific Ocean, has become an ideal location for the cultivation and transportation of coca.

    Our project aimed to transform the utilization of the coca plant in a manner that would result in a legal product, opening up new avenues of production and income for the farmers and croppers. We sought to challenge social prejudices and stereotypes surrounding the coca plant, with the goal of gaining acceptance from society through showcasing its benefits and healing properties. This, in turn, would contribute to economic stability within the community.

      My Role
      </p>
    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      This project held significant importance for me as it provided me with the opportunity to lead a team of 12 designers and 3 engineers for the first time. As the project manager, I had the responsibility of shaping and structuring the project according to our objectives, organizing tasks, ensuring their completion, maintaining constant communication with the internal team and external resources, and mitigating potential project risks. Being a part of this exceptional team helped me define my professional profile and establish an approach that I have since applied to various projects throughout my career.
