    While employed at Peterman Studio in Milan, my responsibilities included designing the content and layout for the new direct email marketing campaigns for our client, SSC Napoli football club. It's worth noting that SSC Napoli was the reigning champion of the Italian national league at that time.
    <p class="projects-copy-text">
    Direct email marketing involves sending emails to individuals who have given their permission, rather than sending unsolicited commercial emails. In the case of the SSC Napoli campaign, emails are sent directly to subscribers and fans. This is done to keep them informed about the team's recent scores, news, upcoming games, events, and other club-related information.

    Marketing emails often incorporate mechanisms that offer senders feedback regarding the campaign's effectiveness. This allows for the tracking of key metrics, such as the number of messages opened and the number of clicks generated. When designing marketing emails, it is crucial to consider making them visually appealing for recipients viewing them on mobile devices. Additionally, it's important to keep the email's body text concise.

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      The client's design requirements included the need for a visually appealing header that could be easily edited whenever the team won or lost a match. Additionally, the design needed to incorporate a section for team articles and the latest news, match reviews, and banners that would redirect users to the team's official website for ticket purchases, subscription options, and downloading the team's official app.

    As a special bonus, I designed a timer to inform readers about the time remaining until the next match, which the client greatly appreciated.
