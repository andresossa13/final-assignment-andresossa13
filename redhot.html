    The project brief involved developing an identity for a particular type of music, specifically focusing on "hidden" gems from the 1990s. The goal was to redesign and expand the album's graphic identity as if it were being released in recent years. In our case, we focused on the iconic album Blood Sugar Sex Magik by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, released in 1991.

      The birth of LPs in the mid-20th century marked a revolutionary era in music, transforming it from a live experience to a tangible product. Long Play vinyl records offered a means of capturing and preserving the magic of music, allowing artists to create concept albums and explore new artistic avenues. Alongside this musical revolution came the era of iconic album covers, which became an essential component of an artist’s identity. These visually striking designs served as gateways to the sonic worlds contained within the LPs, often capturing the essence of the music and the artist’s message.

      To begin, we conducted thorough research on the band and the album itself. We delved deeper into its genre, cultural significance, themes, and lyrics. Our aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the story behind the creation of the record. Our primary source of inspiration came from the documentary “Funky Monks,” which documented the recording of Blood Sugar Sex Magik and was released in 1992.

      Concept

    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      The band described the process as a liberating one, emphasizing their freedom and lack of constraints. Many of the songs on the album were strongly influenced by the band members’ emotional states at the time, which included struggles with drug addiction, relationship issues, and their newfound fame. In light of all this information, we made the decision to incorporate these elements into our new design, ultimately arriving at the concept of psychedelic vibes.
