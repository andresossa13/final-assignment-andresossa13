    The magazine we created revolves around sustainable development goal number 12, which emphasizes responsible consumption and production. Given the wide range of aspects covered by this goal, we decided to concentrate on one area that humans can significantly influence in theri daily lives: Food waste.
    </p>
    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      “The Leftovers,” aims to raise awareness about the problem of food waste and provide readers with practical steps they can take to reduce waste in their own lives. Food waste is a critical issue with far-reaching consequences for the environment, economy, and society. By discarding perfectly good food, we not only squander valuable resources and contribute to climate change but also exacerbate food insecurity and hunger in many parts of the world. Through our in-depth coverage, “The Leftovers” hopes to inspire readers to take action and make a positive impact. We firmly believe that education is key to changing behavior. The articles delve into the root causes of food waste and highlight the most effective strategies for reducing it.

      “The Leftovers” magazine employs the collage technique, incorporating multiple images to address various themes simultaneously. These collages feature photographs of everyday life, vintage pictures, as well as art and miscellaneous images. The purpose of this approach is to effectively convey the message to the reader, particularly a younger audience. The tone is provocative, using both playful and impactful images related to food loss and waste. At first glance, readers may smile or feel alarmed, but the message is always bold. The intentionally designed tone of voice aims to evoke strong reactions or emotions in the reader, making the movement clearer and more compelling.

      My Role
      </p>
    <p class="projects-copy-text">
      In this project, my main role was to translate the hole printed magazine created by my teammates into a digital version. It was not an easy task, but I found it gratifying as I successfully conveyed the same atmosphere from the physical version to a bold, playful, and engaging website. The website was designed to be compatible with both mobile and desktop devices. The printed version of the magazine will be available soon, and I will update the results here as soon as possible.
