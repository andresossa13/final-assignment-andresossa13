      Bogotá has emerged as a global reference in the realm of graffiti. Its remarkable murals and street art have positioned it among cities like Miami, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico City. Although the city’s relationship with graffiti has faced challenges in the past, the power of great art transcends negative labels. Today, Bogotá’s graffiti scene is far from being considered vandalism. It beautifully intertwines social and political commentary with a fusion of local and foreign styles, captivating observers with its ever-evolving nature.

      My city guide prominently features a combination of real-life photographs and illustrated representations of the graffiti. These elements are central to its visual style, utilizing color gradients, shading, and special effects. <br><br> Graffiti, existing in public spaces, serves as a medium for spreading social criticisms while engaging in a dialogue with innovative forms of artistic expression. Consequently, images not only possess the power to communicate messages but also influence our perception of cultural creation. For graffiti artists, their murals serve as a means of expressing emotions and subtly rebelling against repressive authorities, making a strongstatement with their artistry.
